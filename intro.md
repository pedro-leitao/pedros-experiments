This repository serves as a curated collection of experiments, how to's and musings, courtesy of the author, crafted during fleeting moments of respite from the professional and personal arenas -- a rarity these days. As such, readers are advised to approach these writings with a discerning eye and a generous pinch of skepticism.

Covering a spectrum of topics from software, machine learning, software architecture and perhaps, one or the other personal topic, what you find here may offer insights that range from interesting to pointless. The author hopes that you find them useful, or at the very least, entertaining.
