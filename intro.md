This repository serves as a curated collection of experiments, how to's and general commentary, courtesy of the author, created during fleeting moments of respite from the professional and personal arenas -- a rarity these days. As such, readers are advised to approach these articles with a discerning eye and a generous pinch of skepticism.

Covering a spectrum of topics from software, machine learning, software architecture and perhaps, one or the other personal topic, what you find here may offer insights that range from interesting to mildly ammusing. I hope that you find them useful, or at the very least, informative.

As the usual disclaimer, any views expressed here are my own and do not necessarily reflect the views of my employer, or any other entity with which I have been associated with.
